# Perspective Mode Magit Buffer Fix

## Problem
The previous advice function for filtering magit buffers from perspective sessions was completely broken:

1. **Wrong variable name**: Used `persp-hash-table` instead of `*persp-hash*`
2. **Overly complex**: Tried to modify internal data structures during load
3. **Breaking load process**: Caused multiple errors and prevented sessions from loading

## Solution
Replaced the complex filtering approach with **simple error suppression**:

### New Approach
- Uses `condition-case` to catch errors during buffer restoration
- Silently skips magit buffer restoration failures (they can be recreated)
- Allows the rest of the session to load normally
- Warns about non-magit errors but continues loading

### Key Changes
```elisp
(defun my/suppress-persp-magit-errors (orig-fn &rest args)
  "Suppress errors related to magit buffers during perspective loading.
This allows the session load to continue even if some magit buffers fail to restore."
  ;; Wraps persp-buffer-from-savelist with error handling
  ;; Silently skips magit-related errors
  ;; Continues loading other buffers
  ...)
```

### Benefits
1. **Simpler**: Much less code, easier to maintain
2. **Safer**: Doesn't modify internal persp-mode data structures
3. **Effective**: Achieves the goal of loading sessions despite magit buffer issues
4. **Non-invasive**: Only suppresses errors, doesn't change persp-mode behavior

## Testing
To test the fix:

1. Reload your Doom configuration: `M-x doom/reload` or `SPC h r r`
2. Try loading a saved session: `M-x my/load-complete-session`
3. Verify that:
   - The session loads without errors
   - Magit buffer failures are silently skipped
   - Other buffers restore correctly

## Why This Works
- Magit buffers are **ephemeral** - they represent the current state of a git repository
- They should be recreated when needed, not restored from saved state
- By allowing the load to continue despite magit failures, the rest of your workspace restores correctly
- You can simply re-open magit when you need it (it will show current repo state)

## Previous Issues
The old code had these problems:
```elisp
;; WRONG: persp-hash-table doesn't exist
(when (hash-table-p (or phash persp-hash-table))
  ...)

;; WRONG: Trying to modify data structures during load
(set-persp-parameter 'persp-buffer-save-alist filtered-buffer-names persp)
```

The correct variable is `*persp-hash*` (with asterisks), but more importantly, the entire approach of modifying data structures was fundamentally flawed.

## Additional Improvements
The configuration also already includes:

1. **Filter buffers from being saved**:
   ```elisp
   (setq persp-filter-save-buffers-functions
         (list (lambda (b)
                 (not (string-match-p "magit" (buffer-name b))))))
   ```

2. **Safe buffer restoration**:
   ```elisp
   (setq persp-save-buffers-functions
         (list (lambda (savelist)
                 (condition-case err
                     (funcall restore-fn savelist)
                   (error (message "Failed to restore...") nil)))))
   ```

3. **Cleanup functions**:
   - `my/cleanup-magit-buffers-in-workspace`
   - `my/cleanup-problematic-buffers-after-load`
   - `my/pre-save-workspace-cleanup`

These work together to prevent magit buffers from being saved and to handle any that slip through.
